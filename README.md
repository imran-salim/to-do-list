# to-do-list
A to-do list written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
I decided to make this app because I extensively use a to-do list app for my daily activities.
I intend to redo this project with React to see what React abstracts away from this vanilla JavaScript version.
Currently a work-in-progress.
